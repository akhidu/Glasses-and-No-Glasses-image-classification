The presence of eyeglasses is a technical obstruction in facial analysis systems. This is attributed to the generated shadow, reflection and occlusion (blockage) caused by the “glasses frame” that covers the eyes (most important part of the face). This leads to inaccurate output of facial/ocular analysis systems, where the appearance of facial images is changed causing the systems to incorrectly recognize age, gender, facial expression, and facial similarity for each person that appears in the image. The situation is even worse with sunglasses, where the entire ocular area is covered causing failure in eye detection and subsequent systems
